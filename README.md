# 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Kalyani Kumar.Akula**, a passionate learner transitioning from a **teaching background** into the world of **Data Science and Machine Learning**.  

I was pursuing **advanced certifications in Generative AI and Data Science with Edureka (IIT Guwahati)**, from 2024 through June 2025. Alongside this learning, I was join in CHRIS TECH SYSTEMS and  I’ve gained hands-on experience as a **Data Science Intern** at **CHIRS TECH Systems, Unified Mentor, and SkillFied Mentor**.  

During these internships, I worked on **end-to-end data science pipelines** including **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model evaluation**, and building **NLP-based sentiment analysis** and **regression models**. I also explored **Generative AI techniques** like **prompt engineering and NLP automation**, applying them to deliver business-focused solutions.  

With over **7 years of teaching experience** before 2015, I bring **strong communication and problem-solving skills** to my data projects. My academic background in **biological sciences and computer applications** gives me an **interdisciplinary mindset** that helps in tackling real-world business challenges with data-driven strategies.  

I am committed to **continuous learning** and passionate about applying **AI, machine learning, deep learning**, and **Generative AI** to create impactful, intelligent solutions. 🚀
